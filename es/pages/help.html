    <h2>Filosófico</h2><h3>¿Qué es Freenet?</h3><p>Freenet is a platform for censorship-resistant communication and
publishing. It is designed to ensure true freedom of communication over
the Internet. It allows anybody to publish and read information with
complete anonymity. Nobody controls Freenet, not even its creators, meaning
that the system is not vulnerable to manipulation or shutdown. Freenet
is also very efficient in how it deals with information, adaptively
replicating content in response to demand.  For more information,
see <a href="about.html#what-is-freenet">What is Freenet?</a></p><h3>¿En qué sentido es diferente Freenet de Tor? ¿Puedo acceder a Google/Facebook/etc. a través de Freenet?</h3><p>Freenet is a self-contained network, while Tor allows accessing the web
anonymously, as well as using "hidden services" (anonymous web servers).
Freenet is not a proxy: You cannot connect to services like Google or
Facebook using Freenet. However, Freenet has websites, filesharing, forums,
chat, microblogging, email etc, all anonymous and hosted within Freenet.</p><p>Freenet is a distributed datastore, so once content is uploaded to Freenet,
it will remain on Freenet forever, as long as it remains popular, without
fear of censorship or denial of service attacks, and without needing to run
your own web server and keep it online constantly.</p><p>The other big difference is that Freenet has the "darknet" or Friend to
Friend mode, where your Freenet node (software on your computer) only
connects to the Freenet nodes run by your friends, i.e. people you know (and
maybe to their friends, to speed things up). This makes blocking Freenet,
e.g. on a national firewall, extremely difficult.</p><p>However, most people currently use Freenet in "opennet" mode (that is,
connecting automatically to whoever the network assigns, rather than
connecting only to their friends). This is much less secure than using
Freenet in "darknet" mode, and is relatively easy to block, as it does have
some central servers ("seed nodes").</p><p>Freenet has many unsolved problems, and is still experimental. Our objective
for Freenet is to build a global friend-to-friend darknet, which would be
extremely difficult to block, and would provide very strong anonymity and
censorship resistance. This will require further work on Freenet,
on usability, speed and security, but above all it is a techno-social
experiment: Will people know enough friends who are willing to use Freenet to
make such an anonymous friend-to-friend network possible? This is why Freenet
supports "opennet" mode: to let people try it out before they ask their
friends to connect.</p><p>Tor is a little less experimental, and arguably is an easier problem; it may
provide better anonymity today, provided that it isn't blocked, and of
course, Tor lets you access the internet as a whole, whereas on Freenet you
can only access Freenet content. However if you can use a large enough
darknet, Freenet already provides an interesting level of censorship
resistance, DoS resistance and anonymity.</p><p>Using the internet "anonymously" is not necessarily easy: Connecting to
Facebook through Tor doesn't prevent Facebook from knowing pretty much
everything about you, and connecting to your (non-HTTPS) webmail account
through Tor may mean the person running the proxy ("exit node") can steal
your webmail account password.</p><p>Freenet is a separate network, which does things differently, because there
are no central servers. This is why we don't support Javascript, server-side
scripting etc on freesites: Everything must be rewritten to work on a
distributed network. But the advantage is there is no single server which can
be compelled to hand over your private communications or which can be shut
down.</p><p>There are still risks, for example, talking about your home town or internet
provider on an anonymous forum, or downloading files which Freenet can't make
safe such as PDFs or word processor documents (Freenet will warn you about
this). Also, for web content in particular, it may be easier to upload it to
Freenet than set up a hidden server on Tor; you don't need to keep your node
online for your content to be available, you don't need to figure out how to
configure it safely, and most important, if you go away your site will still
be available.</p><h3>Summary:</h3><p>Tor (or I2P):</p><ul>
<li>Lets you access the Internet (but be careful!).</li>

<li>Lets you access anonymous web servers and other services.</li>

<li>Lets you host anonymous web servers, which need to be kept online, and can be
  DoS'ed, but can run any dynamic or server-side content you want.</li>

<li>Provides reasonable anonymity</li>

<li>Has been blocked by several countries, with varying success. Even its hidden
  bridges can be harvested and blocked with moderate effort.</li>

<li>Is somewhat centralised</li>

<li>Is more mature and has more users and developers</li>
</ul><p>Freenet in general:</p><ul>
<li>Only lets you access content uploaded to Freenet, including (static) websites,
  email, filesharing, forums, microblogging, etc. All of which are anonymous
  (or pseudonymous i.e. you create an untraceable identity).</li>

<li>Hosts content in a distributed way: You don't know what your node is storing,
  any given content is distributed across many nodes.</li>

<li>Ensures that popular content will be available forever.</li>

<li>Is older than Tor, but more experimental (arguably it's a harder task).</li>
</ul><p>Freenet in darknet mode: (friend to friend: connects only to your friends' nodes)</p><ul>
<li>Is very hard to block, and this can be improved further with transport plugins.</li>

<li>Provides good anonymity, and with a bit more work it could provide very strong
  anonymity (PISCES tunnels).</li>

<li>Is fully decentralised: No central servers at all.</li>
</ul><p>Freenet in opennet mode: (connect automatically even if you don't know anyone
on Freenet)</p><ul>
<li>Is relatively easy to block.</li>

<li>Provides limited anonymity</li>

<li>Is somewhat centralised</li>
</ul><p>Desafortunadamente la mayoría de la gente usa actualmente Freenet en
modo opennet. La gran pregunta es ¿podemos construir una darknet 
global amigo-a-amigo? ¡Únase a nosotros y averígüelo!</p><p>PS for an example of how dependant Tor is on centralised hidden services,
see <a href="http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1rlo0uu">this</a>

<a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/08/alleged-tor-hidden-service-operator-busted-for-child-porn-distribution/">bust</a>.
Half the hidden services on Tor were using a single hosting service,
whose owner has now been arrested. While we don't approve of these sites,
it does illustrate the point: A centralised network is a vulnerable network.
Unfortunately, decentralised networks are hard, but in the long run they are
more secure.</p><h3>¿Quién está detrás de Freenet?</h3><p>Freenet surge de un diseño para un sistema de publicación anónimo creado
por Ian Clarke mientras era un estudiante en la Universidad de Edimburgo,
Escocia. Desde entonces muchas otras personas han contribuido para
convertir en realidad las propuestas de Ian.</p><h3>¿Si los autores son anónimos cómo puedo confiar en la información?</h3><p>La firma criptográfica de información permite a la gente probar la autoría,
esta técnica se usa frecuentemente para autentificar autorías de correos
electrónicos. Además, en realidad puede firmar información mientras
permanece anónimo, teniendo así un personaje anónimo. Puede probar
que usted escribió distintas piezas de información en Freenet sin revelar su
identidad. De esta manera puede desarrollar una reputación anónima
para fiabilidad.</p><h3>¿Tengo que ceder espacio de disco y ancho de banda?</h3><p>Realmente no está donando en el sentido de perder el espacio de disco y el
ancho de banda; pero tampoco está compartiendo realmente (al menos no
de la misma forma que con los programas de compartición de ficheros). Es
más como aportar al reservorio común de recursos de Freenet.</p><h3>No tengo que ceder nada cuando uso la aplicación de compartición de ficheros X y consigo sacar mas.</h3><p>¿Consigue hacer eso de forma anónima? Freenet está diseñado con el
anonimato en mente, el rendimiento en segundo lugar.</p><h3>Todos mis amigos conceden muy poco espacio y ancho de banda. ¿Debería conceder más?</h3><p>Si está contento con lo que está obteniendo entonces no. Pero si quiere más
debe considerar donar más y ejecutar su nodo lo más próximo a 24x7 que
sea posible, y debe pedir a sus amigos que hagan lo mismo.</p><h3>¿Si cedo mucho mejorará mi experiencia significativamente?</h3><p>Su experiencia definitivamente mejorará, pero para una mejora realmente
grande necesitamos que más gente comience a pensar como usted. El ancho
de banda cuenta más que el espacio de disco.</p><h3>¿Es legal Freenet?</h3><p>We don't currently know of any prosecutions for merely using Freenet.
Some people claim that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DADVSI">DADVSI</a>
makes Freenet illegal in France; the German data retention law might have
required logging, but 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications_data_retention#Germany">was struck down</a>.
Also, the German supreme court has found that 
<a href="http://merlin.obs.coe.int/iris/2010/7/article13.en.html">not securing your wifi properly</a>
makes you responsible for other people's downloads over it; this might or
might not be extended to prohibiting anonymous peer to peer filesharing such
as Freenet. 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACTA">ACTA</a> might have
wide-ranging effects, including on Freenet, should it pass, and similar laws
such as IPRED2 have been tried in the past. There have also been attempts to
force peer to peer systems to provide wiretapping capabilities in the USA,
and there are 
<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19968068">worrying developments</a>
in the UK that might result in it being blocked, but not being made illegal
per se. As far as we know none of these things - apart from the first two -
have passed. Many of these are arguable either way (depending on how broadly
the legislation is applied) and will have to be decided in caselaw. The law
can be an ass sometimes. You can read the EFF's (US-centric) advice to peer
to peer developers 
<a href="https://www.eff.org/wp/iaal-what-peer-peer-developers-need-know-about-copyright-law">here</a>.
If you need legal advice, talk to a lawyer. Also read the next section
especially if you are in China; blocking the protocol may suggest the
authorities don't like us!</p><h3>¿Está Freenet bloqueado por cortafuegos (firewalls) nacionales?</h3><p>The Chinese national firewall (Golden Shield) has blocked our website for
many years, and was observed in 2005 to block the 0.5 protocol as well. This
suggests China doesn't like us, so be careful if you run Freenet in China.
Some other countries (e.g. France) are known to be hostile to peer to peer,
and may eventually force ISPs to block peer to peer networks (but right now
Freenet works fine in France and we have many French users!).</p><p>Technically, Freenet 0.7 has some minimal defences against blocking; the
protocol is relatively hard to identify (we are working on <a href="https://wiki.freenetproject.org/Transport_plugins">"transport
plugins"</a>, which would

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography">make it much harder to detect Freenet</a>.
Freenet supports a 
<a href="https://wiki.freenetproject.org/Darknet">darknet</a> mode (i.e.
only connecting to your friends) which makes automated harvesting and
blocking of nodes very difficult. Note that many mobile internet providers
block all peer to peer networks along with other content, and many corporate
or academic networks may block Freenet (but even if they don't, see

<a href="#can-i-get-in-trouble-if-i-run-a-node">you shouldn't run Freenet at work</a> for non-work purposes!).</p><p>There has been discussion in the US and UK of legislation to require
backdoors and presumably blocking of anything that can't be backdoored. This
is unlikely to pass, especially in the US, where similar laws have been
proposed periodically and are probably unconstitutional. However, even if the
government came to us and demanded a back door, we would be legally unable to
secretly distribute a trojan'ed build, because Freenet is open source,
numerous people have contributed code to it, so legally we have to give you
the source code, including that for any government mandated back doors -
which wouldn't be secret for long! If this happened it is likely that <a href="donate.html">
Freenet Project Incorporated</a>, the non-profit organisation that
runs this website and handles donations, would shut down, but the Freenet
network itself would live on just fine, the only difference being not being
able to pay full time developers as easily.</p><p>See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_neutrality">net neutrality</a> and

<a href="https://www.eff.org/">the EFF</a> or equivalent organisations in your country for
the politics of all this and how you can stop such laws.</p><h3>¿Puedo meterme en problemas si ejecuto un nodo?</h3><p>This is related to <a href="#legal">"Is Freenet legal?"</a>. We have done everything we
can to make it extremely difficult for any sane legal system to justify
punishing someone for running a Freenet node, and there is little precedent
for such action in today's developed countries. Many legal systems recognize
the importance of freedom of speech, which is Freenet's core goal. Having
said that, there is risk in doing anything that your government might not
agree with; you should make an informed decision as to whether to take that
risk. Furthermore, your ISP or hosting provider may have a problem with
Freenet. At least one French hosting provider has been known to ban Freenet (
along with Tor and others) from their servers; please read your terms and
conditions to make sure you are allowed to run Freenet. Note also that
Freenet can use rather a lot of bandwidth, at least 20GB/month, and this may
be a problem on a cheap or shared connection. And of course running it at
work could get you into trouble too, unless it's for work purposes!</p><h3>¿Qué pasa con el copyright?</h3><p>There are some excellent thoughts on this subject on the <a href="about.html#philosophy">Philosophy</a> page. Specific copyright-related laws may be a
problem, please read 
<a href="#is-freenet-legal">Is Freenet legal?</a> and 
<a href="#is-freenet-blocked-by-national-firewalls">Is Freenet blocked by
national firewalls?</a>.</p><h3>¿Qué pasa con la pornografía infantil, el contenido ofensivo o el terrorismo?</h3><p>Aunque la mayoría de la gente desea que la pornografía infantil y el terrorismo
no existan, la humanidad no debe ser privada de su libertad de comunicarse
sólo a causa del modo en que un grupo de personas muy reducido podrían
usar esa libertad.</p><h3>No quiero que mi nodo se use para albergar pornografía infantil, contenido ofensivo, o terrorismo. ¿Qué puedo hacer?</h3><p>This is a problem that sadly any censorship-resistance tool faces.
If the capacity to remove content existed, it might only be used to remove things one finds offensive, but it could be used to remove anything.
From a technological point of view one cannot have censorship-resistance with exceptions.
Freenet is merely a tool that by itself doesn't do anything to promote offensive content.
How people choose to use the tool is their sole responsibility.
As a communication medium, Freenet cannot be considered responsible for what people use it for — just like Internet Service Providers, telecoms, or postal services cannot be held responsible for their users either.</p><p>Note that files are encrypted and split into pieces.
They are not stored on your machine in their entirety.
Your instance of Freenet will likely have very few encrypted pieces of a given file, if any.
These pieces cannot be used as parts of the file they were made from without additional information.
Reassembling a file requires knowing both what pieces to use and the key to decrypt them, neither of which is included with each piece.</p><h3>¿Qué pasa con las restricciones de exportación?</h3><p>El proyecto Freenet ha notificado a las autoridades de EEUU que va a exportar
criptografía. En tanto su país no prohiba el uso de cifrado usted lo hace bien.
Más aún, ¡ahora hay una excepción en las leyes de exportación para software
que haga exactamente lo que hace Freenet! Sin embargo, Oracle limita la
fortaleza del cifrado disponible en la JVM (máquina virtual Java) que ejecuta
Freenet; debería instalar los Unlimited Strength Policy Files (ficheros de política
de fortaleza ilimitada), si es posible, para mejorar su rendimiento. Sin embargo
Freenet funcionará incluso sin esto, mediante el uso de su código de cifrado
integrado.</p><h3>No tengo nada que ocultar y no necesito anonimato. ¿Hay algo más que Freenet pueda ofrecer?</h3><p>Sí, de hecho, incluso sin la característica de anonimato, Freenet es muy
útil a causa de la manera única en que maneja la distribución de contenido
y la carga de información. En términos simples eso significa que puede
publicar un sitio web sin preocuparse de lo grande que será el sitio y sin
tener que colocar rótulos de publicidad de algún otro en él. Aunque es
improbable que los freesites lleguen alguna vez a cargar más rápido que
los sitios web regulares, se adaptan mejor a cambios repentinos del flujo
de visitantes (lo que a menudo ocurre cuando sitios relativamente
desconocidos se enlazan desde un gran sitio), y también son factibles
velocidades razonables de descarga para grandes ficheros. Simplemente
no espere una latencia muy baja.</p><h2>Técnico</h2><h3>¿Cómo uso este software? Lo he descargado, pero cuando lo ejecuto no hay interfaz gráfica (GUI).</h3><p>Fred (the Freenet REference Daemon) runs as a daemon, or service, in the
background. You normally talk to it through a Freenet client. One built-in
client is fproxy, which lets you talk to Freenet with a web browser. Freenet
should have installed a Browse Freenet shortcut on the desktop and/or the
start menu, or a system tray icon (rabbit) with an Open Freenet menu item.
Failing that, point your web browser to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8888/">http://127.0.0.1:8888/</a> for the gateway page. Try clicking the various links
in the bookmark list to reach an initial set of sites.</p><h3>¿Por qué Freenet es tan lento?</h3><p>When you first install Freenet, it will be slow, and you may see Data Not
Found or Route Not Found errors for freesites. This is normal, and Freenet
will speed up significantly over time. For best performance you should try to
run Freenet as close to 24 hours a day as possible. This is why we install
Freenet as a service.</p><p>Please bear in mind that Freenet is inherently high latency: it can take a
while to (for example) load a page for the first time, even if it is capable
of reasonable speeds (as anonymous systems go!) for large popular files. You
can also improve performance for freesite browsing by using a separate
browser and <a href="#connections">increasing its connection limit</a>. You should also
set the datastore size and bandwidth limit as high as possible. But
protecting your anonymity does cost a certain amount of performance. You can
configure how much to a degree by changing the security levels on the page
under Configuration.</p><h3>¿Se puede buscar en Freenet?</h3><p>Sí, hay unos pocos mecanismos de búsqueda distintos. Para buscar la
web de Freenet (freesites), debería simplemente poder usar el recuadro de
búsqueda en la página principal, o ir a Buscar en Freenet en el submenú
Navegar. Si no está allí, vaya a la página Complementos bajo Configuración,
y cargue el complemento Library (biblioteca). Como alternativa Frost y Thaw
también proporcionan búsqueda por mensajes y ficheros. Observe que
buscar en Freenet es bastante más difícil que en otras redes a causa de la
diferente arquitectura y objetivos de diseño de Freenet.</p><h3>¿Cómo consigo poner a funcionar Freenet con un cortafuegos (firewall) o con NAT?</h3><p>Mostly, Freenet should just work with a NAT. However, you should forward the
ports manually if you can. Click on the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8888/connectivity/">Connectivity</a> page. At the top you will see a list of
ports used by the node. You should forward (for UDP) the Darknet FNP and
Opennet FNP ports. You may need to look up your router's documentation to
figure out how to do this. Freenet should have forwarded them itself through

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play">Universal Plug and Play</a>, but this doesn't
always work (and it never works if you don't have the UPnP plugin loaded,
or have one router behind another).</p><p>If you have a dyndns address or other domain name pointing to the computer
you run your Freenet node on, tell the node about it. Go to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8888/config/node?mode=2">the core
settings config page</a> (in advanced
mode), and find the option "IP address override". Put your domain name in
that box, and apply the settings.</p><h3>¿Necesito una conexión a Internet permanente para ejecutar un nodo?</h3><p>No, pero es preferible. Puede ejecutar el software y probarlo desde una
conexión "transitoria" (ej. modem telefónico/móvil), pero para que el
conjunto de la red sea lo más útil posible, necesitaremos tantos nodos
permanentes como sea posible (la mayoría de instalaciones de cable
modem o DSL son suficientemente "permanentes" para esto). Una versión
posterior de Freenet podría sacar provecho de los nodos transitorios.</p><h3>¿Por qué Freenet sólo descarga 1 o 2 ficheros a la vez?</h3><p>Many browsers limit the number of simultaneous connections to something far
too low for efficiently browsing Freenet (since Freenet pages often have much
higher latency than web pages). This can usually be reconfigured. For
example, for Mozilla Firefox, type <strong>about:config</strong> in the address field of
the browser and replace the value of the following settings to the one
stated. Filter on 
<strong>"connections"</strong> to get only the relevant settings:</p><pre><code>network.http.max-connections 200  
network.http.max-connections-per-server 200  
network.http.max-persistent-connections-per-proxy 200  
network.http.max-persistent-connections-per-server 200
</code></pre>
<p>Observe que estas configuraciones causarán que Mozilla Firefox use más
conexiones para toda su navegación, lo cual puede no ser deseable desde el
punto de vista de la congestión de red. Pero de todos modos lo ideal sería que
usara un navegador aparte para Freenet, para lograr la mejor seguridad.</p><h3>¿Por qué no puede Freenet almacenar datos permanentemente?</h3><p>Because we can't find a way to do this without compromising Freenet's other
goals. For example, people often suggest that someone's node could just never
drop data they want to cache permanently. This, however, won't work because
even if the data is still available on their node, there is no way to ensure
that requests for that data will be routed to that node. We have considered
many other ways that Freenet could store data permanently, but they either
won't work, or compromise Freenet's core goals of anonymity, and scalability.</p><p>Content which is popular should persist indefinitely, for example most
freesites linked from the main indexes are still retrievable years later (at
least their front pages are). If the content isn't very popular the best way
to keep it available is to regularly re-insert (re-upload) it. An interesting
option is the "Keepalive" plugin, which will do this for you - even if you
didn't upload the file/site in the first place. Improvements are planned,
such as a special kind of request that allows us to probe whether a file is
available from a random point on the network.</p><h3>¿Por qué está Freenet implementado en Java?</h3><p>Opinions differ about the choice of Java for the reference implementation of
Freenet (even among the core developers). <a href="about.html#people">Ian Clarke</a> and
several other developers are Java proponents and the choice for Java was
made. Even if everybody could be convinced to switch to a different language
reimplementing the current Freenet protocol would be quite a big task,
and take up a significant amount of time, while there is only a limited
amount of developer-time available. Flame wars on the development list about
the language choice aren't welcome, people willing to implement Freenet in
other languages however are very much encouraged to try. Don't underestimate
the amount of work however.</p><h3>¿Cómo permito las conexiones a FProxy desde otras computadoras?</h3><p>If you want everyone to be able to use your node you have the following options:  </p><ul>
<li>Go to the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8888/config/fproxy">web interface configuration page</a> and enable advanced mode</li>

<li>Stop your node and edit freenet.ini manually</li>
</ul><p>In both cases change the following parameters:</p><pre><code>fproxy.bindTo=0.0.0.0  
fproxy.allowedHosts=*
</code></pre>
<p>Of course, this leaves your node wide open, unless you control access with a
firewall of some sort. If you'd prefer to use access controls within Freenet,
then you can use lines like this:</p><pre><code>fproxy.bindTo=0.0.0.0  
fproxy.allowedHosts=127.0.0.1,192.168.1.0/24
</code></pre>
<p>Or even (find your IP address from ipconfig/ifconfig/winipcfg and substitute
it for 192.168.1.1):</p><pre><code>fproxy.bindTo=127.0.0.1,192.168.1.1  
fproxy.allowedHosts=127.0.0.1,192.168.1.0/24
</code></pre>
<p>And if you want to grant full access (i.e. change config settings, restart,
etc) to the node (WARNING: Be very careful who you give full fproxy access
to!):</p><pre><code>fproxy.allowedHostsFullAccess=127.0.0.1,192.168.1.0/24
</code></pre>
<h3>¿Qué novedades hay? ¿Hay un registro de cambios?</h3><p>On every new build, a brief summary of all the main changes is posted to the
support and devl lists and the eng.freenet board on Freetalk. This is usually
relayed to FMS and Frost too. Alternatively, for a much more detailed view,
check out the <a href="https://github.com/freenet/">git repositories</a>. Also,
you should check the developer blogs (from the default bookmarks, or over the
web, e.g. 
<a href="http://amphibian.dyndns.org/flogmirror/">toad</a>), but be warned
they are often not regularly updated and frequently go off on rants on
unrelated topics!</p><h3>¿Por qué hay tantos mensajes en mi fichero de registro (log) con una traza retrospectiva (backtrace) adjunta?</h3><p>Freenet registra (log) mensajes de forma excesiva durante las operaciones normales. Es algo de lo que somos conscientes y en lo que estamos trabajando.</p><h3>Tengo un anti-virus Kaspersky, y Freenet no se instala, o muestra "¡La base de datos de la cola de descarga/subida está corrompida!"</h3><p>Kaspersky can be a problem with Freenet. See <a href="https://wiki.freenetproject.org/Installing/Windows#.27Download.2Fupload_queue_database_corrupted.21.27_.28When_using_Kaspersky_on_Windows_7.29">here</a>.
We recommend you turn off Kaspersky during install and during node startup, and exclude the directory you installed Freenet in (most likely C:\Program Files\Freenet or C:\Program Files (x86)\Freenet).</p><h3>Establecí una contraseña y ahora la he olvidado, ¿qué puedo hacer?</h3><p>The password protects your downloads and uploads and the client-cache (cache
of what you've recently browsed on Freenet). It is stored in the file
master.keys. There is no way to recover the password, but if you forget it
you can wipe your downloads and uploads and the client cache by securely
deleting the file master.keys. See <a href="#privatedata">the question on private data and local
security</a> for more information.</p><h3>Freenet continúa quejandose de desfase de reloj</h3><p>Freenet tendrá problemas si su reloj está siendo constantemente atrasado.
Habitualmente esto sucede cuando algo está reconfigurando su reloj en
en grandes saltos de forma regular. En Linux debe ejecutar ntpd para
asegurarse de que su reloj no está demasiado desfasado (esto no es vital
pero es útil), pero si ve errores de desfase de reloj pruebe a añadirle la
opción -x para evitar grandes saltos hacia atrás. Además, ejecutar ntpdate
en el arranque para que haya un gran salto antes de que se inicie Freenet
es una buena idea. Esto también puede ocurrir a veces en Windows, háganos
saber como consiguió corregirlo...  aunque generalmente la cosa no es tan
seria, especialmente si los grandes saltos de reloj son sólo una vez al día.</p><h2>Publicar</h2><h3>Si publico algo en Freenet, ¿cómo lo encontrará la gente? ¿No tendrían que conocer la clave que usé?</h3><p>Yes, people will have to know what key you used to publish your information.
This means you will have to announce your key in some way.</p><p>The most common way to do this is to send a message, containing your key and
brief description of your information, to the author of one of the existing
Freenet sites. Most of the "portal" sites which are linked from the Freenet
web interface (fproxy) read the Freetalk or FMS forums, and there are boards
specifically for announcing sites (usually the boards are called "sites"!).
You could also send your key to people by using the Freenet <a href="help.html#mailing-lists">mailing lists</a>, in the IRC channel (chat.freenode.net #freenet),
by private e-mail, or by advertising your Freenet site on your World Wide Web
site. If you're feeling extravagant, you could even try skywriting it.
(Graffiti is not recommended, for legal reasons.)</p><h3>¿Cómo publico una Content Hash Key (CHK)?</h3><p>Una Content Hash Key (CHK, clave hash de contenido), se basa en el
contenido real albergado en su interior - y como tal, la clave se conocerá
sólo después de que se haya insertado en Freenet. Para insertar una CHK,
simplemente hágalo como "CHK@", Freenet le dirá cuál es la clave CHK
real una vez la inserción se complete.</p><h3>¿Pueden actualizarse / borrarse los documentos de Freenet?</h3><p>Currently, a document posted to freenet with the same name as one already
present may actually serve to propagate the existing document. there is also
currently no means of deleting a document from freenet. documents that are
never requested are eventually removed through disuse.</p><p>however, you can use an <a href="https://wiki.freenetproject.org/usk">updatable subspace key (usk)</a> to provide a form of updatable freesite:
your node will automatically look for later editions of the site (after you
visit it, or always if you bookmark it), and show you the latest version. you
can force it to search for the latest version by changing the number at the
end of the key to negative.</p><h2>Contribuir</h2><h3>I have this great idea...</h3><p>Good! First step: read the <a href="help.html#mailing-lists">mailing list archives</a>.
Odds are good that someone else had the same idea and discussed it with the
group. Either a flaw was found in the idea, or perhaps it was decided to
postpone implementing the idea until later. Some examples of ideas already
discussed are storing information by content hash, key redirection, signed
keys/data, use of UDP, server discovery, URLs, document versioning,
and others. If you don't see the idea discussed in the archives, by all means
bring it up in the appropriate

"freesites", and downloads, configuration and friend connections can be
managed from the web interface. However, because of weaknesses in current
browsers, we <strong>strongly</strong> recommend that you use a separate browser for
Freenet. Specifically, browser history stealing, in all its forms, is a major
threat if you share a browser between Freenet and the WWW at large: malicious
web pages will be able to probe which freesites you have visited, and report
this information to their owners.</p><p>Privacy/incognito mode may be sufficient, and Windows tray app will start a
browser running in this mode.</p><h3>¿Algún ataque X no romperá el anonimato de Freenet?</h3><p><strong>Short answer</strong>: Probably, on opennet. Maybe, on darknet.</p><p><strong>Long answer</strong>:</p><p>Freenet has a different threat model to Tor and the Mixmaster remailers.
Freenet is designed to resist censorship: The network must therefore be
robust, and content must be distributed without requiring a central server,
whether anonymous or not. Anonymity is important for requesters and
especially for those who upload content in the first place. The typical
example is a corporate or government whistleblower. Generally to find the
originator of some content, the attacker must be able to predict the data in
advance, must be able to move across the network relatively quickly, and must
be able to perform the attack while the data is being inserted; after that,
it is distributed across the network and is much harder to trace, and the
originator may have left the network. However, if by chance or by
overwhelming force the attacker is connected to the whistleblower (or e.g.
seizes the computers of everyone on the network), he may be able to identify
this much more quickly. All of this is vastly more difficult on a darknet,
where everyone connects only to their friends, where it is very hard for an
attacker to find nodes, and where to connect to a given node he must social
engineer its operator! Freenet does support opennet mode (plug and play),
but darknet is far more secure, and far more difficult to block on a national
firewall.</p><p>Tor on the other hand is designed to anonymise real-time data streams,
on the assumption that the list of nodes can be public, that there is a free
world where nodes can be operated safely, that the authors of controversial
content will be able to either host (hidden) web servers themselves or upload
it to other (hidden, but usually centralised) storage systems, and so on. And
Tor has a concept of a "client", which is somebody who uses the service
without providing any value to it; on Freenet, every node relays data for its
neighbours. Hence the attacks on Freenet are completely different to the
attacks on Tor. Both compromise to some degree to enable more or less
real-time performance.</p><p>If you can use the darknet, trust your friends, don't reinsert files, always
use the "Insert a random, safe key" option, and change your anonymous
identity after some volume of inserts, you should be relatively safe using
Freenet. However this has not yet been quantified. If you can connect,
build up some trust in your anonymous persona, insert your controversial
content, and then disappear, again, you are better off with Freenet,
especially if the content is a website (but if you are connecting on opennet,
beware of seednode compromises). In some other cases, Tor is better.</p><p>We are still working on Freenet's security and there are major security
enhancements which have not yet been implemented, most of which will go in
before 1.0. Cryptographic tunnels similar to Tor's onion routing are one
possibility, which would greatly reduce the impact of many of the below
attacks, but there are several other enhancements planned, both to anonymity
and to network robustness/undetectability.</p>
<p><strong>Major known attacks</strong>:</p><p>In the interests of giving would-be users as much information as possible,
and on the assumption that any serious attacker would do their homework,
here are the major classes of attack on Freenet we are presently aware of:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Harvesting</strong>: Simply by running some powerful Freenet nodes, an attacker can
  identify most of the opennet (Strangers network) relatively easily. These
  nodes can then be attacked one by one (subject to resources), their traffic
  analysed, or simply be blocked on a national firewall. Connecting only to
  friends (darknet) largely solves this problem. ISPs may be able to identify
  Freenet nodes with some effort, although we make this fairly difficult:
  Freenet's current protocol is designed to be hard to detect, and steganography
  will be introduced at some point. However, traffic flow analysis, or
  brute-force blocking of all peer to peer traffic (e.g. traffic between IP
  addresses marked as "consumer" rather than "business"), both of which would
  hit a lot of things other than Freenet, would likely be effective for quite
  some time.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Bootstrapping attacks</strong>: Unless a node only connects to friends, it will
  have to connect to the opennet "seednodes" to announce itself and get
  initial peers to connect to. At the moment there are relatively few
  seednodes and the list is maintained manually. The seednodes could be blocked
  easily by a national firewall etc, but also, there is little to prevent
  attackers from setting up their own seednodes and submitting them, and then
  "capturing" any new Freenet users who connect to their nodes, in order to
  observe their traffic etc. Freenet will try to announce to multiple seednodes,
  but see the below section on "correlation attacks", which generally are
  feasible with only a single connection to the target. So this is a question of
  resources - if the attacker has the resources to surveil all new Freenet
  nodes, he has a good chance of pulling it off. In future we may have more
  seednodes, and only reveal a small proportion of them to each node, as Tor
  does with its hidden bridges, but that will not prevent attackers from
  creating lots of malicious seednodes and getting them into the official lists,
  and it will likely still be possible to block all the seednodes with some
  effort (something similar has already happened to Tor hidden bridges in
  China). Combined with harvesting and adaptive search attacks, this attack
  explains why opennet is regarded by many core developers as hopelessly
  insecure. If you want good security you need to connect only to friends. Hit
  and run inserts are possible, and can be relatively safe in terms of many of
  the other attacks, but you are taking the risk that the opennet seednode you
  connect to may be malicious.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Correlation attacks</strong>: If you are connected to a node, and can recognise the
  keys being requested (probably because it was posted publicly), you can show
  statistically that the node in question probably requested it, based on the
  proportion of the keys requested from that node, the locations of nearby
  nodes, the HTL on the requests and so on. This will be largely eliminated
  by tunnels (but these will be quite expensive so may need to be turned off
  by default except for predictable blocks), but in any case it requires a
  rather powerful attacker compared to the next attack... Note also that if you
  only connect to your friends, a remote attacker will have to either co-opt
  your friends or social engineer you into giving them a connection; either way,
  connecting to the entire network this way is rather expensive: If they already
  suspect you personally they'll probably bug your keyboard rather than trying
  to connect to your Freenet node!</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Adaptive search</strong>: If you want to find the author of some content, and you
  can predict the exact keys which will be inserted, and you are able to
  connect to new nodes at will, you may be able to listen out for the keys,
  guess where they must have come from, connect to nodes near there, and if your
  guess is correct, get more keys which gives you a more accurate fix on the
  originator, so the attack gets faster and faster and eventually converges on
  the originator. This attack is most powerful with inserts of big, predictable
  files, but the "Insert a random, safe key" option will make the keys
  unpredictable even if the content is guessable, by using random encryption
  keys. The downside is it produces a different key each time for the same file,
  and you can never safely reinsert the same file to the same key. Given that
  Freenet's data persistence is currently relatively poor, this is a problem.
  Anyway, if you <em>can</em> use the random keys option, the attacker is unable to
  move towards you until after you announce the file: Most of his samples will
  come not from the actual content inserts but from chat posts. There are far
  fewer of these, and changing your pseudonymous identity periodically will
  help, provided the attacker cannot easily connect the new identity to the old
  one. Using a dedicated identity for posting sensitive content, which doesn't
  chat too much, again will help. Another thing which makes a huge difference is
  connecting only to your friends (i.e. using darknet): This makes it extremely
  difficult for an attacker to get new connections closer to where he thinks you
  must be, just as it helps with correlation attacks. So the biggest problems
  with this attack are 1) Files which are not very popular fall off Freenet
  relatively quickly, so need to be reinserted, but it is not safe to reinsert
  to the same key (this is why we have the "Insert a canonical key" option, for
  those who don't care about attacks), and 2) Chat can still be attacked.
  Tunnels will help to deal with both problems, and by default will only be used
  for predictable keys so can be relatively slow without this causing problems
  in practice. Also there is work going on on various techniques to allow users
  to do reinserts safely via for example preventing the attacker from seeing
  requests started before he connected. Another important point is this only
  works if the source is uploading new content, or chatting, regularly; creating
  and bootstrapping a new pseudonymous identity over a short period, doing a
  single insert (of any size) with the safe random key option, and announcing
  it, should be relatively safe from this attack, even on opennet - but see the
  section above on bootstrapping attacks.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Traffic analysis</strong>: Freenet provides minimal protection against global
  traffic analysis (basic message padding etc); if the attacker also has
  nodes on the network, the extra data will likely be helpful. We certainly do
  not guarantee that it is impossible to trace data transfers from one node to
  the next with detailed traffic data, however it is hoped that this will fall
  down on the busier nodes. One day we will implement steganographic transports
  and/or constant bitrate links as an option for more paranoid users. Note that
  on Tor-style networks, global traffic analysis will defeat the network
  completely: all that is needed is to observe both the entry and exit points.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Swapping attacks</strong>: It is possible to attack the location swapping
  algorithm, and thereby disrupt routing on friend-to-friend networks. This has
  been demonstrated by the authors of the Pitch Black paper. We are working on a
  solution, but sadly at the moment most users use opennet.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>More information on the current practical state of Freenet security is available
<a href="https://wiki.freenetproject.org/Security_summary">here</a>.</p><h3>¿Es Freenet vulnerable a ataques de inundación (flood)?</h3><p>Short answer: no.</p><p>Long answer:</p><p>We don't think so. Aside from protecting freedom of speech, Freenet is also
designed to be an efficient dynamic caching system. If information is
requested a lot from a limited number of nodes, the nodes that the requests
pass through will cache the information, lowering the load on the network. If
information is inserted on a limited set of nodes and then subsequently
requested a lot from a separate set of nodes, with repetition, the sets will
close in on one another in the network topology until they are "neighbors"
and only the originally targeted nodes are suffering from the attack.</p><p>In other words, in order to harm Freenet with a flood you need to
consistently change your point of entry into the network and continually
insert and request new data, and you will still only increase the workload
for the network that is linear to your own. Given an immense will and
capacity greater than the total of the entire network, it is possible to
cripple any public network (including the Internet itself) with floods,
but it is our intention to always keep Freenet as resistant to this as
theoretically possible.</p><p>Curiously enough, the above analysis only applies to <a href="https://wiki.freenetproject.org/Opennet">Opennet</a>. On Darknet, you might have a little
more success, although it would be much harder to change your entry point in
any significant way. Nonetheless, you have a reasonably low bandwidth
multiplier (the total number of nodes visited, around 20 on average), and you
are severely limited by the number of nodes you can connect to, which will be
low on a darknet.</p><h3>¿Por qué transformar en hash las claves y cifrar los datos cuando un operador de nodo podría identificarlos (los datos) de todos modos si lo intenta?</h3><p>Transformar en hash la clave y cifrar los datos no pretende ser un método
para evitar que los operadores de nodo Freenet sean capaces de averiguar
qué tipo de información hay en sus nodos si de verdad lo desean (después de
todo, simplemente pueden buscar la clave de la misma forma que lo haría
alguien que pide la información) sino más bien evitar que los operadores
tengan que conocer qué información hay en sus nodos si no lo desean. Esta
distinción es más una distinción legal que técnica. No es realista esperar que
un operador de nodo trate continuamente de recopilar y/o adivinar claves
posibles y luego las compruebe contra la información en su nodo (incluso si
tal ataque es viable desde una perspectiva de seguridad), así que una
sociedad sana es menos probable que responsabilice a un operador por la
presencia de tal información en la red.</p><h3>¿Qué pasa con los hostiles nodos "cáncer" en el interior de la red?</h3><p>The existence of malicious nodes within the network is the most difficult
problem that a distributed network must face, and has been the bane of many
previous ideas. Many systems (such as multiplayer gaming networks) try to
avoid malicious nodes by keeping the protocol and code closed, but we have
yet to see an example of that working in the long run. And anyway it is
opposed to Freenet's philosophy.</p><p>Freenet is based on a balance of positive and negative feedback loops that
bring requests for information to a node when it is functioning well,
and keep requests away from it when it is not. The key to avoiding "cancers"
is (as in the body) to make sure these loops can correctly identify even the
most carefully designed malicious node and not keep sending requests to it.
This issue is not fully dealt with by the current test code, but you can rest
assured that a number of possible solutions have been on the table and
discussed for some time now. Several have been implemented (enforcing hashes
or signatures on content, per node failure tables, backing off from a node
that causes timeouts ...)</p><h3>¿Qué pasa con el ataque Y?</h3><p>Freenet aún está en pruebas y hay ataques que se van a encontrar de los
que aún no nos hemos encargado. Así que si consigue resolver un
verdadero nuevo tipo de ataque, estamos interesados en escucharle sobre
ello. Sin embargo, por favor, tenga en cuenta lo que es Freenet y lo que no
es. No hay una sola red que pueda ofrecer todo a todos, y hay problemas
de seguridad de los que Freenet, por su naturaleza, puede que no se ocupe
en la medida en la que podría usted desear. Si esto le molesta, todo nuestro
código está libremente disponible, así que es libre de tomar de él tanto como
quiera y escribir su propia red distribuida que satisfaga sus deseos.</p><h3>¿Qué datos privados almacena Freenet? ¿Cómo me libro de ellos? ¿Cómo puedo asegurar mi computadora de forma que esté seguro cuando ejecuto Freenet?</h3><p>First of all, we <strong>strongly</strong> suggest that you install Freenet inside an
encrypted drive using, for example, 
<a href="http://www.truecrypt.org/">Truecrypt</a>.
It is not possible for Freenet to prevent all leaks of private data,
especially if you download media files etc. Even if you only browse freesites
and use the chat plugins, there will still be potentially incriminating data
in your swapfile, which needs to be encrypted (on recent versions of Windows
you could try the command "fsutil behavior set encryptpagingfile 1",
but really the solution is to encrypt your whole system including swap). It
is also essential that you use your web browser in privacy mode, or with
cache and history turned off; we try to do this if you launch Freenet via the
rabbit icon, but there are no guarantees as unfortunately this functionality
seems buggy in current web browsers. Browser plugins could also be a problem,
and you should use a separate browser for Freenet if in any doubt. Be careful
with the files you download from Freenet - not only could anyone seizing your
computer see you have them (media files are likely to be written to disk even
if you open them directly in your web browser and never save them), but also
they could contain threats to anonymity themselves, such as calling back to a
malicious website etc; this is possible in for instance PDFs and some video
formats. Freenet tries to warn you about this when it can't filter out such
malicious content: Currently it can only filter HTML pages, GIF/PNG/JPEG
images and CSS, and MP3s, but we will add support for Ogg soon and other
formats later. And of course there are many other threats - you should take
standard security precautions, such as not running operating systems that are
no longer updated, not running software not from a trustworthy source,
using appropriate security software etc (if you have a firewall make sure it
allows the two UDP ports Freenet needs through).</p><p>Because not all users will have installed encrypted drives at the time when
they first install Freenet, Freenet itself attempts to encrypt all the
potentially incriminating data that it stores on disk. Details are below but
as explained, leaks are inevitable: you really should <a href="http://www.truecrypt.org/">encrypt your disks!</a></p><p>The main datastore does not store data you request or insert (or that is
requested or inserted by nearby nodes), because it can be probed by other
nodes: This was introduced to fix <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/05/13/freener_not_so_anonymous/">this attack</a> publicised
by The Register. Freenet has a separate client-cache, which stores data which
you have recently requested to avoid having to go back to the network every
time (which would not only reduce speed but also security, by giving
attackers more opportunities to see your requests). Also, Freenet stores the
list of your downloads and uploads (which you can see on the Filesharing
menu), their current progress, and various other data, in the file node.db4o
(or node.db4o.crypt). The actual data is kept in the persistent-temp-
<em>
directory. Unless you set the physical security level to LOW, this data is
encrypted. At MAXIMUM, the encryption keys are never written to disk, so the
data is effectively wiped on restarting the node; otherwise the encryption
keys are stored in a file called master.keys (on HIGH this is passworded).
You can wipe the data by either using the panic button on the
downloads/uploads page or by securely deleting master.keys. Freenet also
creates temporary files for other requests, which are also encrypted unless
physical seclevel is LOW, which are in temp-</em>. Also, some plugins may create
their own data files, which may contain for instance messages you have posted
or downloaded from chat forums, and currently bookmarks and recently
completed files are stored in plain text. It is our intention to move these
into node.db4o or store them in separate encrypted databases, as soon as we
have automatic backups for node.db4o. See 
<a href="https://wiki.freenetproject.org/Program_files">here</a> for details on some of the
files.</p><h3>El filtro Windows SmartScreen advierte que el instalador de Freenet podría poner mi PC en riesgo. ¿Qué está pasando?</h3><p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/smartscreen-filter-frequently-asked-questions-ie9">SmartScreen</a> is sometimes incorrect in classifying a file as dangerous.
We believe our installer is not infected with malicious software, and if you are a developer you can check the installer source code 
<a href="https://github.com/freenet/wininstaller-innosetup">here</a>.</p><h3>¿Alguien ha afrontado alguna vez problemas legales por sus actividades anónimas desarrolladas en Freenet?</h3><p>Yes.
There is one such instance that we know of.
United States law enforcement can identify anonymous users of <a href="http://www.thedickinsonpress.com/news/north-dakota/3885239-predators-police-online-struggle">Freenet</a> and 
<a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/court-docs-show-a-university-helped-fbi-bust-silk-road-2-child-porn-suspects">Tor</a>.
Without further information we do not know how they did this, but we suspect it affects people using the network security level "normal" or lower.
It is reasonable to assume that other governments have access to the same technology, which is provided by private contractors.
If you are concerned about governments, you should use Freenet's capacity to connect only to users you trust, ("high" network security level or higher) and bear in mind that no anonymity technology provides perfect protection.</p><p>While we applaud law enforcement's apparent success in apprehending suspects allegedly sharing child abuse images, any security flaws they may have used are not limited to such noble usage.
Many governments persecute and prosecute political dissidents for legitimate speech published online.
Therefore we hope to discover and fix these flaws to protect those who fight for human rights, against corruption, for a peaceful future, and for other legitimate goals.</p><h3>Additional information sources</h3><ul>
