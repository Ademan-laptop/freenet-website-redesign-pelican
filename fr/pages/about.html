    <h2>Qu'est-ce que Freenet ?</h2><blockquote>
<p>I worry about my child and the Internet all the time, even though she's too
young to have logged on yet. Here's what I worry about. I worry that 10 or
15 years from now, she will come to me and say 'Daddy, where were you when
they took freedom of the press away from the Internet?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>--Mike Godwin, <a href="https://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a></p><p>Freenet est un logiciel libre qui vous permet, de façon anonyme, de partager
des fichiers, de parcourir et de publier des « sitesFree » (sites Web accessibles
uniquement par Freenet), de clavarder sur des forums, le tout sans craindre
la censure. Freenet est décentralisé afin de le rendre moins vulnérable aux
attaques, et s'il est utilisé en mode « réseau invisible » qui implique que les
utilisateurs se connectent seulement à leurs amis, il est très difficile à détecter.</p><p>Les communications des nœuds Freenet sont chiffrées et acheminées par d'autres
nœuds afin qu'il soit extrêmement difficile de déterminer qui demande
l'information et quel en est le contenu.</p><p>Les utilisateurs contribuent au réseau en donnant de la bande passante  et une partie
de leur disque dur (appelée « magasin de données ») pour le stockage de fichiers. Les fichiers
sont automatiquement conservés ou supprimés suivant leur popularité,
les moins populaires étant détruits  pour faire place à du contenu plus récent ou plus populaire.
Les fichiers sont chiffrés. L'utilisateur ne peut donc pas découvrir facilement ce que contient
son magasin de données et, avec un peu de chance, ne peut pas en être tenu responsable. Les forums de discussion,
les sites Web et la fonction de recherche s'appuient sur ce magasin de données distribué.</p><p>Freenet a été téléchargé plus de 2 millions de fois depuis le début du  projet
et a été utilisé pour la diffusion d'informations censurées partout dans le monde, incluant des pays comme la Chine et au Moyen-Orient. Les idées et concepts précurseurs
de Freenet ont eu un impact significatif dans le milieu universitaire.
Notre article de 2000 intitulé « Freenet: A Distributed Anonymous Information Storage and Retrieval System
(Freenet : un système de stockage et de récupération d'informations anonyme et distribué) » a été l'article scientifique le plus cité de 2000 d'après Citeseer,
et Freenet a aussi inspiré des articles dans les milieux juridique et philosophique.
Ian Clarke, créateur de Freenet et coordinateur du projet,
a été choisi comme l'un des 100 premiers innovateurs de 2003 par le magazine « Technology Review » du MIT.</p><p>Le « réseau invisible » est un développement important récent que très peu d'autres réseaux possèdent :
en ne se connectant qu'à des personnes de confiance, les utilisateurs peuvent grandement réduire leur vulnérabilité,
tout en se connectant à un réseau mondial par l'intermédiaire des amis des amis de leurs amis, etc.
Cela permet l'utilisation de Freenet en des lieux où Freenet pourrait être illégal, rend le blocage des gouvernements très difficile,
et ne dépend pas d'une tunnellisation vers le « monde libre ».</p><p><em>Written by Ian Clarke</em></p><ol>

</ol><h2>The Philosophy Behind Freenet</h2><ol>
<li>
<h3 id="a-disclaimer">A Disclaimer</h3>
<p>There are many reasons why people get involved in the Freenet Project. Some
share the views outlined in this document; some share variations of these views,
which are also served by what we are trying to achieve; and some just enjoy the
technical challenge. These are the ideas which motivated me to architect the
system in the first place, but not necessarily the views that everyone involved
in the Freenet Project holds.</p>
</li>

<li>
<h3 id="suggested-prior-reading">Suggested prior reading</h3>
<p>For this document to make sense, you should probably know what Freenet is. You
can get a good overview from <a href="about.html#introduction">What is Freenet?</a>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<h3 id="the-importance-of-the-free-flow-of-information">The importance of the Free flow of information</h3>
<p>Freedom of speech, in most western cultures, is generally considered to be one
of the most important rights any individual might have. Why is the freedom to
share ideas and opinions so important? There are several ways to answer this
question.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h3 id="communication-is-what-makes-us-human">Communication is what makes us human</h3>
<p>One of the most obvious differences between mankind and the rest of the animal
kingdom is our ability to communicate sophisticated and abstract concepts. While
we constantly discover that animal's communication ability is more sophisticated
than previously assumed, it is unlikely that any other animal approaches our own
level of ability in this area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3 id="knowledge-is-good">Knowledge is good</h3>
<p>Most people, given the option of knowing something and not knowing something,
will choose to have more information rather than less. Wars have been won and
lost over who was better-informed. This is because being better-informed allows
us to make better decisions, and generally improve our ability to survive and be
successful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3 id="democracy-assumes-a-well-informed-population">Democracy assumes a well informed population</h3>
<p>Many people today live under democratic governments, and those who don't,
probably want to. Democracy is an answer to the question of how to create
leaders, while preventing them from abusing that power. It achieves this by
giving the population the power to regulate their government through voting,
yet the ability to vote does not necessarily mean that you live in a
democratic country. For a population to regulate their government effectively
it must know what their government is doing, they must be well informed. It
is a feedback loop, but this loop can be broken if the government has the
power to control the information the population has access to.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>
<h3 id="censorship-and-freedom">Censorship and freedom</h3>
<p>Everyone values their freedom, in fact, many consider it so important that
they will die for it. People like to think that they are free to form and
hold whatever opinions they like, particularly in western countries. Consider
now that someone had the ability to control the information you have access
to. This would give them the ability to manipulate your opinions by hiding
some facts from you, by presenting you with lies and censoring anything that
contradicted those lies. This is not some Orwellian fiction, it is standard
practice for most western governments to lie to their populations, so much
so, that people now take it for granted, despite the fact that this
undermines the very democratic principles which justify the government's
existence in the first place.</p>
</li>

<li>
<h3 id="the-solution">The solution</h3>
<p>The only way to ensure that a democracy will remain effective is to ensure
that the government cannot control its population's ability to share
information, to communicate. So long as everything we see and hear is
filtered, we are not truly free. Freenet's aim is to allow two or more people
who wish to share information, to do so.</p>
</li>

<li>
<h3 id="isnt-censorship-sometimes-necessary">Isn't censorship sometimes necessary?</h3>
<p>Of course no issue is black and white, and there are many who feel that
censorship is a good thing in some circumstances. For example, in some
European countries propagating information deemed to be racist is illegal.
Governments seek to prevent people from advocating ideas which are deemed
damaging to society. There are two answers to this however. The first is that
you can't allow those in power to impose "good" censorship, without also
enabling them to impose "bad" censorship. To impose any form of censorship a
government must have the ability to monitor and thus restrict communication.
There are already criticisms that the anti-racism censorship in many European
countries is hampering legitimate historical analysis of events such as the
second world war.</p>
<p>The second argument is that this "good" censorship is counter-productive even
when it does not leak into other areas. For example, it is generally more
effective when trying to persuade someone of something to present them with
the arguments against it, and then answer those arguments. Unfortunately,
preventing people from being aware of the often sophisticated arguments used
by racists, makes them vulnerable to those arguments when they do eventually
encounter them.</p>
<p>Of course the first argument is the stronger one, and would still hold-true
even if you didn't accept the second. Basically, you either have censorship,
or you don't. There is no middle-ground.</p>
</li>

<li>
<h3 id="but-why-is-anonymity-necessary">But why is anonymity necessary?</h3>
<p>You cannot have freedom of speech without the option to remain anonymous.
Most censorship is retrospective, it is generally much easier to curtail free
speech by punishing those who exercise it afterward, rather than preventing
them from doing it in the first place. The only way to prevent this is to
remain anonymous. It is a common misconception that you cannot trust
anonymous information. This is not necessarily true, using digital signatures
people can create a secure anonymous pseudonym which, in time, people can
learn to trust. Freenet incorporates a mechanism called "subspaces" to
facilitate this.</p>
</li>

<li>
<h3 id="and-what-of-copyright">And what of copyright?</h3>
<p>Of course much of Freenet's publicity has centered around the issue of
copyright, and thus I will speak to it briefly. The core problem with
copyright is that enforcement of it requires monitoring of communications,
and you cannot be guaranteed free speech if someone is monitoring everything
you say. This is important, most people fail to see or address this point
when debating the issue of copyright, so let me make it clear:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>You cannot guarantee freedom of speech and enforce copyright law</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is for this reason that Freenet, a system designed to protect Freedom of
Speech, must prevent enforcement of copyright.</p>
</li>

<li>
<h3 id="but-how-will-artists-be-rewarded-for-their-work-without-copyright">But how will artists be rewarded for their work without copyright?</h3>
<p>Firstly, even if copyright were the only way that artists could be rewarded
for their work, then I would contend that freedom is more important than
having professional artists (those who claim that we would have no art do not
understand creativity: people will always create, it is a compulsion,
the only question is whether they can do it for a living).</p>
<p>Secondly, it could be questioned whether copyright is effective even now. The
music industry is one of the most vocally opposed to enhancements in
communication technology, yet according to many of the artists who should be
rewarded by copyright, it is failing to do so. Rather it has allowed
middle-men to gain control over the mechanisms of distribution, to the
detriment of both artists and the public.</p>
</li>

<li>
<h3 id="alternatives-to-copyright">Alternatives to Copyright</h3>
<p>Fortunately it won't come to this. There are many alternative ways to reward
artists. The simplest is voluntary payment. This is an extension of the
patronage system which was frequently used to reward artists prior to
copyright, where a wealthy person would fund an artist to allow them to
create full-time. The Internet permits an interesting extension of this idea,
where rather than having just one wealthy patron, you could have hundreds of
thousands, contributing small amounts of money over the Internet.</p>
<p>We actually practice what we preach in this regard too, on the 15th of March
2001 the Freenet Project started taking donations, and within a week we had
collected over $1000.</p>
